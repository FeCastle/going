# github.com/markbates/going

This project houses, what I consider to be some help packages for writing Go applications. Your mileage may vary, but I find them to be pretty darn helpful.

## Packages

* [nulls](http://github.com/markbates/going/nulls) - Proper JSON implementations of `null` database types.
* [validate](http://github.com/markbates/going/validate) - A framework for writing validations.
* [wait](http://github.com/markbates/going/wait) - Wait cleans up the pattern around using `sync.WaitGroup`.
